Here, we developed and applied a robust ribonucleoprotein capture protocol to uncover the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome. We report 109 host factors that directly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs including general antiviral factors such as ZC3HAV1, TRIM25, and PARP12. Applying RNP capture on another coronavirus HCoV-OC43 revealed evolutionarily conserved interactions between viral RNAs and host proteins. Network and transcriptome analyses delineated antiviral RBPs stimulated by JAK-STAT signaling and proviral RBPs responsible for hijacking multiple steps of the mRNA life cycle. By knockdown experiments, we further found that these viral-RNA-interacting RBPs act against or in favor of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive list of RBPs regulating coronaviral replication and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.","tags":null,"title":"The SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome.","type":"working"},{"authors":["D.

Here we report the m6A demethylase FTO (Fat Mass and Obesity associated) functions as a conserved regulator of motile ciliogenesis and ciliopathy by stabilizing FOXJ1 mRNA. Loss of Fto in mice produced strong asthma-like phenotypes upon allergen challenge owing to defective ciliated cells in the tracheal epithelium. Depletion of Fto in *Xenopus laevis* embryos also caused multiple embryonic ciliopathic phenotypes such as situs inversus and loss of multiciliated cells in the epidermis. Transcriptome analysis revealed a widespread downregulation of ciliary genes after Fto knockdown. We found that a single target, Foxj1, the master ciliary transcription factor, as the phenocritical target of the Fto-dependent m6A demethylation in motile ciliogenesis. Fto demethylates two m6A sites in the open reading frame of Foxj1 to stabilize the mRNA. In human bronchial epithelial cells, FTO depletion also led to FOXJ1 mRNA destabilization and a severe loss of ciliated cells with an increase of neighboring goblet cells, as in chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma. Altogether, our results identify the FTO-FOXJ1 axis as a conserved key regulatory module in ciliogenesis and ciliopathy.","tags":null,"title":"N6-methyladenosine demethylase FTO orchestrates motile ciliogenesis by stabilizing FOXJ1 mRNA.","type":"working"},{"authors":["**Y.
