The incorporation of non-adenosines in poly(A) tails, or 'mixed tailing', has been observed in vertebrates and viruses. Here, to quantitate the effect of mixed tails, we mathematically modeled deadenylation reactions at single-nucleotide resolution using an in vitro deadenylation system reconstituted with the complete human CCR4-NOT complex. Applying this model, we assessed the disrupting impact of single guanosine, uridine or cytosine to be equivalent to approximately 6, 8 or 11 adenosines, respectively. CCR4-NOT stalls at the 0, -1 and -2 positions relative to the non-adenosine residue. CAF1 and CCR4 enzyme subunits commonly prefer adenosine but exhibit distinct sequence selectivities and stalling positions. Our study provides an analytical framework to monitor deadenylation and reveals the molecular basis of tail sequence-dependent regulation of mRNA stability.","tags":["RNA modification"],"title":"Deadenylation kinetics of mixed poly (A) tails at single-nucleotide resolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ku J\\*","Lee K\\*","Ku D","Kim S","Lee J","Bang H","Kim N","Do H","**Lee H**","Lim C","Han J","**Lee YS**\\#","Kim Y\\#"],"categories":["Molecular biology"],"content":"","date":1706572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706572800,"objectID":"669e3053acad6268c568acacd2d17832","permalink":"https://2yngskl.github.io/publication/24-iralu/","publishdate":"2024-01-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/24-iralu/","section":"publication","summary":"Inverted Alu repeats (IRAlus) are abundantly found in the transcriptome, especially in introns and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Yet, the biological significance of IRAlus embedded in 3' UTRs remains largely unknown. Here, we find that 3' UTR IRAlus silences genes involved in essential signaling pathways. We utilize J2 antibody to directly capture and map the double-stranded RNA structure of 3' UTR IRAlus in the transcriptome. Bioinformatic analysis reveals alternative polyadenylation as a major axis of IRAlus-mediated gene regulation. Notably, the expression of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), an inhibitor of p53, is upregulated by the exclusion of IRAlus during UTR shortening, which is exploited to silence p53 during tumorigenesis. Moreover, the transcriptome-wide UTR lengthening in neural progenitor cells results in the global downregulation of genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, via IRAlus inclusion. Our study establishes the functional landscape of 3' UTR IRAlus and its role in human pathophysiology.","tags":["RNA structure"],"title":"Alternative polyadenylation determines the functional landscape of inverted Alu repeats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Fabia B**","**Kim M**","**Lim J**","**Lee YS**\\#"],"categories":["Molecular biology"],"content":"","date":1697155200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697155200,"objectID":"93d238dee6117617cd41b387a3fa0e5e","permalink":"https://2yngskl.github.io/publication/23-modeling/","publishdate":"2023-10-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/23-modeling/","section":"publication","summary":"A sequence of deadenylation events, or the shortening of the poly(A) tail, is a highly regulated process during the life cycle of mRNAs.

Despite its importance in posttranscriptional regulations, the kinetics of deadenylation and its regulation remain largely unexplored. Here we identify La ribonucleoprotein 1, translational regulator (LARP1) as a general decelerator of deadenylation, which acts mainly in the 30-60-nucleotide (nt) poly(A) length window. We measured the steady-state and pulse-chased distribution of poly(A)-tail length, and found that deadenylation slows down in the 30-60-nt range. LARP1 associates preferentially with short tails and its depletion results in accelerated deadenylation specifically in the 30-60-nt range. Consistently, LARP1 knockdown leads to a global reduction of messenger RNA abundance. LARP1 interferes with the CCR4-NOT-mediated deadenylation in vitro by forming a ternary complex with poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and poly(A). Together, our work reveals a dynamic nature of deadenylation kinetics and a role of LARP1 as a poly(A) length-specific barricade that creates a threshold for deadenylation.","tags":["RNA modification"],"title":"Short poly (A) tails are protected from deadenylation by the LARP1â€“PABP complex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Little is known about the function of these lncRNAs in the virus life cycle. Here, we dissected the functional and molecular landscape of HCMV lncRNAs. We found that HCMV lncRNAs occupy ~ 30% and 50-60% of total and poly(A)+viral transcriptome, respectively, throughout virus life cycle. RNA1.2, RNA2.7, and RNA4.9, the three abundantly expressed lncRNAs, appear to be essential in all infection states. Among these three lncRNAs, depletion of RNA2.7 and RNA4.9 results in the greatest defect in maintaining latent reservoir and promoting lytic replication, respectively. Moreover, we delineated the global post-transcriptional nature of HCMV lncRNAs by nanopore direct RNA sequencing and interactome analysis. We revealed that the lncRNAs are modified with N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and interact with m6A readers in all infection states. In-depth analysis demonstrated that m6A machineries stabilize HCMV lncRNAs, which could account for the overwhelming abundance of viral lncRNAs. Our study lays the groundwork for understanding the viral lncRNA-mediated regulation of host-virus interaction throughout the HCMV life cycle.","tags":["Protein-RNA"],"title":"Functional and molecular dissection of HCMV long non-coding RNAs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

For example, these types of data are found in elections, where we observe precinct-level vote tallies (observations) of individual citizens' votes (particles) across each of the candidates or ballot measures (features), where each voter is part of a specific voter cohort or demographic (factor). Like the hierarchical Dirichlet process, NDMs rely on two tiers of Dirichlet processes to explain the data with an unknown number of latent factors; each observation is modeled as a weighted average of these latent factors. Unlike existing models, NDMs recover how factor distributions vary locally for each observation. This uniquely allows NDMs both to deconvolve each observation into its constituent factors, and also to describe how the factor distributions specific to each observation vary across observations and deviate from the corresponding global factors. We present variational inference techniques for this family of models and study its performance on simulated data and voting data from California. We show that including local factors improves estimates of global factors and provides a novel scaffold for exploring data.","tags":["Probabilistic modeling"],"title":"Nonparametric Deconvolution Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.
